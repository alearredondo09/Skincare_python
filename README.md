# Programming-class
Repository to have my final project for the class "Computational Thinking for Engineer" 

**Theme of the project:**

My idea of the project is based on the fact that people are going to come to him to ask him about a better skincare routine, hair and what they can do to maintain a good diet depending on their skin type, the way they want to have their hair and what is the goal they have for their diet.

I find this interesting because several women, especially teenagers, do not know where to go to get this type of information or what information is true
